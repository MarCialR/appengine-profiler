#summary 5. Documentation for the cProfile profiler.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Initial source =

The idea for this profiler was borrowed from the [http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/commontasks.html#profiling Google App Engine documentation]. We just packed it and tried to make it even a bit more easier to use.

= Integration =

To activate this profiler, first rename your application's *main()* function to *real_main()*. Then, add a new *main()* function to your application:
{{{
import lib.profiler.cprofile

def real_main():
        run_wsgi_app(application)

# You definitely want to rename the original main() function to real_main() and define a new main() function just for the profiler!
def main():
        lib.profiler.cprofile.run('real_main()', globals(), locals())
}}}

If you want to disable the profiler temporarily, you can modify your new main() function as follows:
{{{
def real_main():
        run_wsgi_app(application)

def main():
        #lib.profiler.cprofile.run('real_main()', globals(), locals())
        real_main()
}}}

Note that you definitely want to rename the original main() function to real_main() and define a new main() function just for the profiler. App Engine caches if you have a function named main(), and you will get in trouble if you do not follow this renaming rule.

== Optional arguments ==

There are some optional named arguments which you can pass to the *run()* function:
  * *accumulate_subfunction_calls* (default is False): Affects the sort_stats() order of cProfile. True makes it 'cumulative' (usually not very useful), False makes it 'time'.
  * *lines_limit* (default is 20): Affects how many lines will be output at most.

= Profiling information and output =

For sample output, please review the [http://code.google.com/p/appengine-profiler/wiki/Screenshots#Request_profiler Wiki screenshots page].

The output is directly taken from the [http://www.python.org/doc//current/library/profile.html?highlight=cprofile#module-pstats Python cProfile module], and therefore there is no need to duplicate the documentation here.
