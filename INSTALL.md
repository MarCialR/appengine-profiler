The installation involves two steps:
  1. Copy the Python library in your application source - [review the INSTALL file](http://code.google.com/p/appengine-profiler/source/browse/trunk/INSTALL) in the SVN repository.
  1. Modify your application's code, so that you enable the profilers - review the documentation of each profiler in the Wiki for detailed instructions and examples.
