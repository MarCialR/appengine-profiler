You have to checkout/copy the files here in your "lib" directory, in a subdirectory "profiler".

Example:
  * Project's root directory is "project1".
  * You need to create/have a subdirectory named "lib": "project1/lib".
  * Then go into this directory by:
	cd project1/lib
  * Download the source of the profiler by:
	svn checkout http://appengine-profiler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk profiler
